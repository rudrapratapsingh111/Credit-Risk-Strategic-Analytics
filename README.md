# Credit-Risk-Strategic-Analytics
This project develops a robust, data-driven system for monitoring, controlling, and analyzing risk within a financial lending portfolio. It integrates advanced data management and analytical tools to produce strategic insights and high-quality risk reporting necessary for executive decision making.

Key Features & Analytical Workflow
Data Engineering & KPI Generation (SQL & Python):

Executed robust SQL queries to manage and structure client data and define the initial dataset.

Utilized Python (Pandas, NumPy) for complex feature engineering and calculating essential Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

Risk Reporting & Control (Excel & SQL):

Designed the risk reporting framework, using aggregated SQL data fed into Excel for advanced statistical analysis and generating visualizations.

Conducted rigorous variance analysis in Excel to identify anomalies and support a control mindset toward portfolio management.

Predictive Performance & Strategic Insight (Python Libraries):

Developed and tuned machine learning models (ANN, Random Forest) using Python libraries like Scikit-learn.

The resulting analysis provides strategic insights to help steer strategic business decisions and define clear key risk drivers.
